We arrived in Vienna and spent the afternoon sweating our bollocks off exploring the city in blistering heat whilst trying to conserve energy for next leg of the journey. While we were walking through Austria’s capital, we saw a horse taxi and started contemplating about upgrading our cart with something that few more horsepower. But we were told that horses don’t run on sans plom 95 so we scrapped that idea.

We wondered around for a bit and eventually found a decent coffee bar with good internet where we updated our blog and started planning the next massive drive from Vienna to Romania. This trip is bad enough in a car that is capable of 70mph let alone our wonder wagon which is lucky to average 40mph with the wind behind us.

On the overnight crusade, we stopped off in Budapest, Hungry for a few hours for a breakneck tour of the city. On our hike to the fisherman’s bastion to get a good view over the Danube, we bumped into another team who we got chatting with. They were staying in the Marriott waiting for their FedEx’d driving licence to turn up since they had only passed their test the day before the launch.

Seeing the the Hungarian parliament building and Chain Bridge lit up at night are extraordinarily memorable sights and make Budapest one of our favourite places we’ve been so far.
