Istanbul is steeped in some amazing history. It's a city that has been through the hands of many emperors, been renamed over half a dozen times and is currently home to 14 million people. It's the melting pot where two entire continents meet. We woke up from the expensive hotel mistake the night before and spent all day exploring the place. We loved it. We walked through the Grand Bazaar which is one of the largest and oldest covered markets in the world. It didn't interest us that much because it was full of jewellery shops, but it was still dazzling to look at and bustling with people.

We saw the Blue Mosque built at the peak of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century in the Faith district of the city. Outside, the imperial mosque's distinctive architecture is iconic in the Istanbul skyline. Aaron donned a dress to cover up his legs and we went inside to find magnificently decorated domes and huge stained glass windows which were just as impressive as the exterior.

Next, we visited the old underground water cisterns and walked through TopkapÄ± palace garden situated at the top of the Sarayburnu, one of 7 heavily fortified hills in Istanbul. In 37 degree heat, we continued wandering around the city and saw some parked cars with Mongol Rally stickers on them. In the cobbled streets of the old town we saw a mini cooper belonging to a Polish team and a Fiat Panda with what looked like a shed load of parking tickets on it.
