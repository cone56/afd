Packing our buggy is like a game of Tetris. To fit all our stuff in the tiny space available, everything has its right place. But sometimes we get lazy and throw things in and wonder why the boot doesn’t close. Before we got motoring in the morning we attempted to reorganise our gear and used this moment to exit the underground car park while the little feather didn’t weigh as much. Following the shredding of pounds, our motor cruised up the incline easily.

With our route planned on freshly downloaded maps, we motored along the autobahns at 45mph and managed to get quite a few miles under our belt until we heard the fateful sound of a panda mobile yet again. Making out we didn’t know that we weren’t allowed on the autobahn, they informed us that our car was unsuitable for the highways. This is starting to sound familiar, but it was a bit more serious than the telling off we received in France. The police convoyed us into a test centre and our Ligier was scrutineered to determine its road worthiness. It wasn’t good news. Even though we tried to say our 4 wheeled banger recently scraped through the annual Motor Ordinance Test in the UK, our car was not exemplary in Germany. The Germans didn’t buy our argument and fined us €1000. We left the autobahns and didn’t go back. Lesson learnt.

It was an incredibly long drive on the German equivalent of A-roads to Munich, but after regular driving shifts and keeping awake on coffee and red bull we made up some good ground. Despite having angered lorry drivers sitting on our tail for the most of the journey, and the many times we heard ‘wichsers’ shouted at us, we made it to Munich. Here we decided to push on to the border with Austria and made it to the capital, Vienna.
